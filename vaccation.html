      <p>Copenhagen, Denmark’s capital, sits on the coastal islands of Zealand and Amager.
       It’s linked to Malmo in southern Sweden by the Öresund Bridge. Indre By, the city's historic
       center, contains Frederiksstaden, an 18th-century rococo district, home to the royal
        family’s Amalienborg Palace.</p>

      <p> Nearby is Christiansborg Palace and the Renaissance-era
        Rosenborg Castle, surrounded by gardens and home to the crown jewels. Most of Copenhagen's most popular attractions
        and sights are within walking distance. With a history that dates back to 1043, the city is full of historic
        landmarks, significant buildings and interesting sights and museums.</p>

      <p>Travel hack: Some attractions and museums do not allow luggage. LuggageHero and several other services help you store
      your bags, so you can use your day of departure exploring the city's attractions without dragging your luggage along.</p>

           <li><h3>Freetown Christiania</h3></li>
           <p>Freetown Christiania, also known as Christiania of about 850 to 1,000 residents, covering 19 acres in the
             borough of Christianshavn in the Danishcapital city of Copenhagen. Christiania has been a source of controversy
              since its creation in a squatted military area in 1971. Its cannabis trade was tolerated by authorities until 2004.
               Since then, relations between Christiania and Danish authorities have been strained. Since the beginning of
               the 2010s, the situation has been normalized and the common Danish law now applies to Christiania.</p>

          <li><h3>Frederiksstaden</h3></li>
          <p>Frederiksstaden is a district in Copenhagen, Denmark. Constructed during the reign of Frederick V in the second
            half of the 18th century,[1] it is considered to be one of the most important rococo complexes in Europe[2]
             and was included in the 2006 Danish Culture Canon. It was developed to commemorate the 300 years jubilee of the
             House of Oldenburg ascending to the Danish thrones</p>

          <p>Based on the fairy tale of the same name by Danish author Hans Christian Andersen, the small and unimposing
            statue is a Copenhagen icon and has been a major tourist attraction since its unveiling in 1913.
            In recent decades it has become a popular target for defacement by vandals and political activists</p>
